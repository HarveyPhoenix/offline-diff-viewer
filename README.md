## Why another diff viewer

I realise we are missing a diff viewer that is

- Privacy focused
- Simple to use
- And most importantly does not store any data on server to give sharable diff urls

## Build Setup

```bash
# install dependencies
$ npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:3000
$ npm run dev

# build for production and launch server
$ npm run build
$ npm run start

# generate static project
$ npm run generate
```

For detailed explanation on how things work, check out the [documentation](https://nuxtjs.org).

# TODO

- Add support for multiple languages like json,yaml,xml etc
- Enable syntax highlighting
- Auto detect language
- Add small shadow to line numbers
- Fix toast issue. (Click on copy button while toast is on)
